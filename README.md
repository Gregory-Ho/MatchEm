# MemoryGame
A game for a high school project programmed in Java using the swing libraries.

The game tests your memory as it requires you to memorize the location of as many cards as you can before the cards are flipped over. You have unlimited time to match all the cards. Everytime you try to match two cards the first card will be shown. The second card you match the first card with will remain covered. Match all cards to finish the game.

Objective:
Match all cards with the least amount of clicks.

Process of the game:
Start the game by hitting the start button.
You will get a countdown to when the cards are revealed.
After the countdown you will be presented with two identical card sets. (These are the two sets you need to match with their pair.)
Try to memorize the location of each pair of cards. You will have a couple seconds to do this.
The cards will be flipped and hidden.
Match all the cards with their identical twin pair.
When you are done you will be presented with your score. The lower the score the better.
